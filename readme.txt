Add the operating-system's abbreviation as a CSS-Class to the body-tag.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a abbreviation of the operating system (win, mac, linux, iPad, iPhone) to the body-tag.
So if there's a OS-specific difference, you can easily react to it by using the css-selector (e.g. ".mac").

Next steps of this plugin:
* adding a settings page 
* add the class to specified elements
* add user-language-abbreviation to specified elements

let me know, if you wish something helpful.



== Installation ==

1. Upload `OS Adder` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or access it via the wordpress plugin site
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. You're done.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the added Class also tell me if it's a 32 or 64 bit OS? =

No, it's just "win", "mac", "linux", iPad, iPod, iPhone or "os-unknown".
When it's a "Linux armv7l"-machine, the plugin outputs "android".
